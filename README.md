During the academic year 2022-2023, our team of five students participated in the Gujarat Robofest 3.0 competition, representing our Robotics Club with pride and determination. The competition provided a dynamic platform for us to apply our knowledge in robotics, from the initial design and development phases to the final implementation and testing of our robots. Throughout the event, we faced a series of challenging tasks that required innovative problem-solving, effective teamwork, and strategic planning. Our participation allowed us to not only demonstrate our technical proficiency and creativity but also to engage with like-minded peers and gain valuable insights into advanced robotics concepts. This experience significantly enhanced our skills and prepared us for future endeavors in the field of robotics.

## Problem Statement

A locomotion-based Hexapod (6 legs). The main task is to control the locomotion of the hexapod, make it walk some distance (forward, backward, right, and left), and make it climb the obstacle with at least 2 repetitions. No readymade kits/chassis are allowed. No external controls are permitted.
